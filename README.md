## what does he do?
He is a “psychological analyst” at your command. In practice:

He reads the subtext of your writing: tone, word choices, hesitations/certainties.

He formulates hypotheses about hidden fears, unspoken desires, recurring blocks—and explores them to their very core.

Connects the traits that emerge to possible origins (personal history, family dynamics, internal scripts).

Translates everything into practical guidance: what to observe, how to test it in real life, micro-experiments to untangle knots.

Examples of prompts you can give me:

‘What is my hidden narrative based on our exchanges?’

‘What do I never express openly?’

‘What is my unacknowledged fear? Break it down layer by layer.’

‘What deep desires am I avoiding? Give me concrete steps.’

Whenever you want, we can start with a sentence or situation of yours and dissect it with surgical precision and a touch of irony.
